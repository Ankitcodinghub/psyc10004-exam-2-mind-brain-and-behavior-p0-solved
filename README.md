What is the difference between a single sample z-test and a single sample t-test?

The z-test uses the mean and the t-test uses the standard deviation.

The z-test requires knowledge about the population mean, and the t-test does not.

The z-test depends on the size of the sample but the t-test does not.

The z-test requires knowledge about the population standard deviation and the t-test does not.

Question 116 1 pts

The following is the output for a scatterplot of negative affect versus scores on the Kessler-10 scale. Negative affect is a psychological construct relating to negative feelings and emotions. The Kessler-10 is a measure of general psychological distress. For the two variables, higher scores suggest more negative feelings and

Question 117 1 pts

A single sample z-test:

involves calculating a z-score for the population mean, assuming that the standard deviation is obtained from the sample. It compares the sample mean with the population mean.

involves calculating a z-score for the sample mean, assuming that the standard deviation is estimated from the sample. It compares the sample mean with a given number.

involves calculating a z-score for the sample mean. This requires that the standard deviation of the population be known. It compares the sample mean with the population standard deviation.

Question 120 1 pts

A researcher is interested in the effects of a drug on physical activity levels. The researcher has designed a scale for activity levels that in the general population has a mean of 56 and a standard deviation of 6. On the scale a higher score indicates higher activity. A random sample of 24 people is given the drug. The mean activity levels of the sample in the week after the administration of the drug is 49. The null hypothesis (μ0) is that the sample mean should equal ______?
